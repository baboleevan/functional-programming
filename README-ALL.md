# Pure and partial functions

In the first chapter we've seen an informal definition of a pure function:

> A pure function is a procedure that given the same input always returns the same output and does not have any observable side effect.

Such an informal statement could leave space for some doubts, such as:

- what is a "side effect"?
- what does it means "observable"?
- what does it mean "same"?

Let's see a formal definition of the concept of a function.

**참고**. If `X` and `Y` are sets, then with `X × Y` we indicate their _cartesian product_, meaning the set

```
X × Y = { (x, y) | x ∈ X, y ∈ Y }
```

The following [definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_function_concept) was given a century ago:

**Definition**. A \_function: `f: X ⟶ Y` is a subset of `X × Y` such as
for every `x ∈ X` there's exactly one `y ∈ Y` such that `(x, y) ∈ f`.

The set `X` is called the _domain_ of `f`, `Y` is it's _codomain_.

**Example**

The function `double: Nat ⟶ Nat` is the subset of the cartesian product `Nat × Nat` given by `{ (1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 6), ...}`.

In TypeScript we could define `f` as

```typescript
const f: Record<number, number> = {
  1: 2,
  2: 4,
  3: 6
  ...
}
```

<!--
TODO:
Please note that the set `f` has to be described _statically_ when defining the function (meaning that the elements of that set cannot change with time for no reason).
In this way we can exclude any form of side effect and the return value is always the same.
-->

The one in the example is called an _extensional_ definition of a function, meaning we enumerate one by one each of the elements of its domain and for each one of them we point the corresponding codomain element.

Naturally, when such a set is infinite this proves to be problematic. We can't list the entire domain and codomain of all functions.

We can get around this issue by introducing the one that is called _intensional_ definition, meaning that we express a condition that has to hold for every couple `(x, y) ∈ f` meaning `y = x * 2`.

This the familiar form in which we write the `double` function and its definition in TypeScript:

```typescript
const double = (x: number): number => x * 2
```

The definition of a function as a subset of a cartesian product shows how in mathematics every function is pure: there is no action, no state mutation or elements being modified.
In functional programming the implementation of functions has to follow as much as possible this ideal model.

**Quiz**. Which of the following procedures are pure functions?

```typescript
const coefficient1 = 2
export const f1 = (n: number) => n * coefficient1

// ------------------------------------------------------

let coefficient2 = 2
export const f2 = (n: number) => n * coefficient2++

// ------------------------------------------------------

let coefficient3 = 2
export const f3 = (n: number) => n * coefficient3

// ------------------------------------------------------

export const f4 = (n: number) => {
  const out = n * 2
  console.log(out)
  return out
}

// ------------------------------------------------------

interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
}

export declare const f5: (id: number) => Promise<User>

// ------------------------------------------------------

import * as fs from 'fs'

export const f6 = (path: string): string =>
  fs.readFileSync(path, { encoding: 'utf8' })

// ------------------------------------------------------

export const f7 = (
  path: string,
  callback: (err: Error | null, data: string) => void
): void => fs.readFile(path, { encoding: 'utf8' }, callback)
```

The fact that a function is pure does not imply automatically a ban on local mutability as long as it doesn't leaks out of its scope.

![mutable / immutable](images/mutable-immutable.jpg)

**Example** (Implementazion details of the `concatAll` function for monoids)

```typescript
import { Monoid } from 'fp-ts/Monoid'

const concatAll = <A>(M: Monoid<A>) => (as: ReadonlyArray<A>): A => {
  let out: A = M.empty // <= local mutability
  for (const a of as) {
    out = M.concat(out, a)
  }
  return out
}
```

The ultimate goal is to guarantee: **referential transparency**.

The contract we sign with a user of our APIs is defined by the APIs signature:

```typescript
declare const concatAll: <A>(M: Monoid<A>) => (as: ReadonlyArray<A>) => A
```

and by the promise of respecting referential transparency. The technical details of how the function is implemented are not relevant, thus there is maximum freedom implementation-wise.

Thus, how do we define a "side effect"? Simply by negating referential transparency:

> An expression contains "side effects" if it doesn't benefit from referential transparency

Not only functions are a perfect example of one of the two pillars of functional programming, referential transparency, but they're also examples of the second pillar: **composition**.

Functions compose:

**Definition**. Given `f: Y ⟶ Z` and `g: X ⟶ Y` two functions, then the function `h: X ⟶ Z` defined by:

```
h(x) = f(g(x))
```

is called _composition_ of `f` and `g` and is written `h = f ∘ g`

Please note that in order for `f` and `g` to combine, the domain of `f` has to be included in the codomain of `g`.

**Definition**. A function is said to be _partial_ if it is not defined for each value of its domain.

Vice versa, a function defined for all values of its domain is said to be _total_

**Example**

```
f(x) = 1 / x
```

The function `f: number ⟶ number` is not defined for `x = 0`.

**Example**

```typescript
// Get the first element of a `ReadonlyArray`
declare const head: <A>(as: ReadonlyArray<A>) => A
```

**Quiz**. Why is the `head` function partial?

**Quiz**. Is `JSON.parse` a total function?

```typescript
parse: (text: string, reviver?: (this: any, key: string, value: any) => any) =>
  any
```

**Quiz**. Is `JSON.stringify` a total function?

```typescript
stringify: (
  value: any,
  replacer?: (this: any, key: string, value: any) => any,
  space?: string | number
) => string
```

In functional programming there is a tendency to only define **pure and total functions**. From now one with the term function we'll be specifically referring to "pure and total function". So what do we do when we have a partial function in our applications?

A partial function `f: X ⟶ Y` can always be "brought back" to a total one by adding a special value, let's call it `None`, to the codomain and by assigning it to the output of `f` for every value of `X` where the function is not defined.

```
f': X ⟶ Y ∪ None
```

Let's call it `Option(Y) = Y ∪ None`.

```
f': X ⟶ Option(Y)
```

In functional programming the tendency is to define only pure and and total functions.

Is it possible to define `Option` in TypeScript? In the following chapters we'll see how to do it.

# Algebraic Data Types

A good first step when writing an application or feature is to define it's domain model. TypeScript offers many tools that help accomplishing this task. **Algebraic Data Types** (in short, ADTs) are one of these tools.

<!--
  What are the other tools?
-->

## What is an ADT?

> In computer programming, especially functional programming and type theory, an algebraic data type is a kind of composite type, i.e., **a type formed by combining other types**.

Two common families of algebraic data types are:

- **product types**
- **sum types**

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/adt.png" width="400" alt="ADT" />
</p>

Let's begin with the more familiar ones: product types.

## Product types

A product type is a collection of types T<sub>i</sub> indexed by a set `I`.

Two members of this family are `n`-tuples, where `I` is an interval of natural numbers:

```typescript
type Tuple1 = [string] // I = [0]
type Tuple2 = [string, number] // I = [0, 1]
type Tuple3 = [string, number, boolean] // I = [0, 1, 2]

// Accessing by index
type Fst = Tuple2[0] // string
type Snd = Tuple2[1] // number
```

and structs, where `I` is a set of labels:

```typescript
// I = {"name", "age"}
interface Person {
  name: string
  age: number
}

// Accessing by label
type Name = Person['name'] // string
type Age = Person['age'] // number
```

Product types can be **polimorphic**.

**Example**

```typescript
//                ↓ type parameter
type HttpResponse<A> = {
  readonly code: number
  readonly body: A
}
```

### Why "product" types?

If we label with `C(A)` the number of elements of type `A` (also called in mathematics, **cardinality**), then the following equation hold true:

```typescript
C([A, B]) = C(A) * C(B)
```

> the cardinality of a product is the product of the cardinalities

**Example**

The `null` type has cardinality `1` because it has only one member: `null`.

**Quiz**: What is the cardinality of the `boolean` type.

**Example**

```typescript
type Hour = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12
type Period = 'AM' | 'PM'
type Clock = [Hour, Period]
```

Type `Hour` has 12 members.
Type `Period` has 2 members.
Thus type `Clock` has `12 * 2 = 24` elements.

**Quiz**: What is the cardinality of the following `Clock` type?

```typescript
// same as before
type Hour = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12
// same as before
type Period = 'AM' | 'PM'

// different encoding, no longer a Tuple
type Clock = {
  readonly hour: Hour
  readonly period: Period
}
```

### When can I use a product type?

Each time it's components are **independent**.

```typescript
type Clock = [Hour, Period]
```

Here `Hour` and `Period` are independent: the value of `Hour` does not change the value of `Period`. Every legal pair of `[Hour, Period]` makes "sense" and is legal.

## Sum types

A sum type is a a data type that can hold a value of different (but limited) types. Only one of these types can be used in a single instance and there is generally a "tag" value differentiating those types.

In TypeScript's official docs they are called [discriminated union](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/unions-and-intersections.html).

It is important to note that the members of the union have to be **disjoint**, there can't be values that belong to more than one member.

**Example**

The type:

```typescript
type StringsOrNumbers = ReadonlyArray<string> | ReadonlyArray<number>

declare const sn: StringsOrNumbers

sn.map() // error: This expression is not callable.
```

is not a disjoint union because the value `[]`, the empty array, belongs to both members.

**Quiz**. Is the following union disjoint?

```typescript
type Member1 = { readonly a: string }
type Member2 = { readonly b: number }
type MyUnion = Member1 | Member2
```

Disjoint unions are recurring in functional programming.

Fortunately `TypeScript` has a way to guarantee that a union is disjoint: add a specific field that works as a **tag**.

**참고**: Disjoint unions, sum types and tagged unions are used interchangeably to indicate the same thing.

**Example** (redux actions)

The `Action` sum type models a portion of the operation that the user can take i a [todo app](https://todomvc.com/).

```typescript
type Action =
  | {
      type: 'ADD_TODO'
      text: string
    }
  | {
      type: 'UPDATE_TODO'
      id: number
      text: string
      completed: boolean
    }
  | {
      type: 'DELETE_TODO'
      id: number
    }
```

The `type` tag makes sure every member of the union is disjointed.

**참고**. The name of the field that acts as a tag is chosen by the developer. It doesn't have to be "type". In `fp-ts` the convention is to use a `_tag` field.

Now that we've seen few examples we can define more explicitly what algebraic data types are:

> In general, an algebraic data type specifies a sum of one or more alternatives, where each alternative is a product of zero or more fields.

Sum types can be **polymorphic** and **recursive**.

**Example** (linked list)

```typescript
//               ↓ type parameter
export type List<A> =
  | { readonly _tag: 'Nil' }
  | { readonly _tag: 'Cons'; readonly head: A; readonly tail: List<A> }
//                                                              ↑ recursion
```

**Quiz** (TypeScript). Which of the following data types is a product or a sum type?

- `ReadonlyArray<A>`
- `Record<string, A>`
- `Record<'k1' | 'k2', A>`
- `ReadonlyMap<string, A>`
- `ReadonlyMap<'k1' | 'k2', A>`

### Constructors

A sum type with `n` elements needs at least `n` **constructors**, one for each member:

**Example** (redux action creators)

```typescript
export type Action =
  | {
      readonly type: 'ADD_TODO'
      readonly text: string
    }
  | {
      readonly type: 'UPDATE_TODO'
      readonly id: number
      readonly text: string
      readonly completed: boolean
    }
  | {
      readonly type: 'DELETE_TODO'
      readonly id: number
    }

export const add = (text: string): Action => ({
  type: 'ADD_TODO',
  text
})

export const update = (
  id: number,
  text: string,
  completed: boolean
): Action => ({
  type: 'UPDATE_TODO',
  id,
  text,
  completed
})

export const del = (id: number): Action => ({
  type: 'DELETE_TODO',
  id
})
```

**Example** (TypeScript, linked lists)

```typescript
export type List<A> =
  | { readonly _tag: 'Nil' }
  | { readonly _tag: 'Cons'; readonly head: A; readonly tail: List<A> }

// a nullary constructor can be implemented as a constant
export const nil: List<never> = { _tag: 'Nil' }

export const cons = <A>(head: A, tail: List<A>): List<A> => ({
  _tag: 'Cons',
  head,
  tail
})

// equivalent to an array containing [1, 2, 3]
const myList = cons(1, cons(2, cons(3, nil)))
```

### Pattern matching

JavaScript doesn't support [pattern matching](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pattern-matching) (neither does TypeScript) but we can simulate it with a `match` function.

**Example** (TypeScript, linked lists)

```typescript
interface Nil {
  readonly _tag: 'Nil'
}

interface Cons<A> {
  readonly _tag: 'Cons'
  readonly head: A
  readonly tail: List<A>
}

export type List<A> = Nil | Cons<A>

export const match = <R, A>(
  onNil: () => R,
  onCons: (head: A, tail: List<A>) => R
) => (fa: List<A>): R => {
  switch (fa._tag) {
    case 'Nil':
      return onNil()
    case 'Cons':
      return onCons(fa.head, fa.tail)
  }
}

// returns `true` if the list is empty
export const isEmpty = match(
  () => true,
  () => false
)

// returns the first element of the list or `undefined`
export const head = match(
  () => undefined,
  (head, _tail) => head
)

// returns the length of the the list, recursively
export const length: <A>(fa: List<A>) => number = match(
  () => 0,
  (_, tail) => 1 + length(tail)
)
```

**Quiz**. Why's the `head` API sub optimal?

**참고**. TypeScript offers a great feature for sum types: **exhaustive check**. The type checker can _check_, no pun intended, whether all the possible cases are handled by the `switch` defined in the body of the function.

### Why "sum" types?

Because the following identity holds true:

```typescript
C(A | B) = C(A) + C(B)
```

> The sum of the cardinality is the sum of the cardinalities

**Example** (the `Option` type)

```typescript
interface None {
  readonly _tag: 'None'
}

interface Some<A> {
  readonly _tag: 'Some'
  readonly value: A
}

type Option<A> = None | Some<A>
```

From the general formula `C(Option<A>) = 1 + C(A)` we can derive the cardinality of the `Option<boolean>` type: `1 + 2 = 3` members.

### When should I use a sum type?

When the components would be **dependent** if implemented with a product type.

**Example** (`React` props)

```typescript
import * as React from 'react'

interface Props {
  readonly editable: boolean
  readonly onChange?: (text: string) => void
}

class Textbox extends React.Component<Props> {
  render() {
    if (this.props.editable) {
      // error: Cannot invoke an object which is possibly 'undefined' :(
      this.props.onChange('a')
    }
    return <div />
  }
}
```

The problem here is that `Props` is modeled like a product, but `onChange` **depends** on `editable`.

A sum type fits the use case better:

```typescript
import * as React from 'react'

type Props =
  | {
      readonly type: 'READONLY'
    }
  | {
      readonly type: 'EDITABLE'
      readonly onChange: (text: string) => void
    }

class Textbox extends React.Component<Props> {
  render() {
    switch (this.props.type) {
      case 'EDITABLE':
        this.props.onChange('a') // :)
    }
    return <div />
  }
}
```

**Example** (node callbacks)

```typescript
declare function readFile(
  path: string,
  //         ↓ ---------- ↓ CallbackArgs
  callback: (err?: Error, data?: string) => void
): void
```

The result of the `readFile` operation is modeled like a product type (to be more precise, as a tuple) which is later on passed to the `callback` function:

```typescript
type CallbackArgs = [Error | undefined, string | undefined]
```

the callback components though are **dependent**: we either get an `Error` **or** a `string`:

| err         | data        | legal? |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------ |
| `Error`     | `undefined` | ✓      |
| `undefined` | `string`    | ✓      |
| `Error`     | `string`    | ✘      |
| `undefined` | `undefined` | ✘      |

This API is clarly not modeled on the following premise:

> Make impossible state unrepresentable

A sum type would've been a better choice, but which sum type?
We'll see how to handle errors in a functional way.

**Quiz**. Recently API's based on callbacks have been largely replaced by their `Promise` equivalents.

```typescript
declare function readFile(path: string): Promise<string>
```

Can you find some cons of the Promise solution when using static typing like in TypeScript?

## Functional error handling

Let's see how to handle errors in a functional way.

A function that returns errors or throws exceptions is an example of a partial function.

In the previous chapters we have seen that every partial function `f` can always be brought back to a total one `f'`.

```
f': X ⟶ Option(Y)
```

Now that we know a bit more about sum types in TypeScript we can define the `Option` without much issues.

### The `Option` type

The type `Option` represents the effect of a computation which may fail (case `None`) or return a type `A` (case `Some<A>`):

```typescript
// represents a failure
interface None {
  readonly _tag: 'None'
}

// represents a success
interface Some<A> {
  readonly _tag: 'Some'
  readonly value: A
}

type Option<A> = None | Some<A>
```

Constructors and pattern matching:

```typescript
const none: Option<never> = { _tag: 'None' }

const some = <A>(value: A): Option<A> => ({ _tag: 'Some', value })

const match = <R, A>(onNone: () => R, onSome: (a: A) => R) => (
  fa: Option<A>
): R => {
  switch (fa._tag) {
    case 'None':
      return onNone()
    case 'Some':
      return onSome(fa.value)
  }
}
```

The `Option` type can be used to avoid throwing exceptions or representing the optional values, thus we can move from:

```typescript
//                        this is a lie ↓
const head = <A>(as: ReadonlyArray<A>): A => {
  if (as.length === 0) {
    throw new Error('Empty array')
  }
  return as[0]
}

let s: string
try {
  s = String(head([]))
} catch (e) {
  s = e.message
}
```

where the type system is ignorant about the possibility of failure, to:

```typescript
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'

//                                      ↓ the type system "knows" that this computation may fail
const head = <A>(as: ReadonlyArray<A>): Option<A> =>
  as.length === 0 ? none : some(as[0])

declare const numbers: ReadonlyArray<number>

const result = pipe(
  head(numbers),
  match(
    () => 'Empty array',
    (n) => String(n)
  )
)
```

where **the possibility of an error is encoded in the type system**.

If we attempt to access the `value` property of an `Option` without checking in which case we are, the type system will warn us about the possibility of getting an error:

```typescript
declare const numbers: ReadonlyArray<number>

const result = head(numbers)
result.value // type checker error: Property 'value' does not exist on type 'Option<number>'
```

The only way to access the value contained in an `Option` is to handle also the failure case using the `match` function.

```typescript
pipe(result, match(
  () => ...handle error...
  (n) => ...go on with my business logic...
))
```

Is it possible to define instances for the abstractions we've seen in the chapters before? Let's begin with `Eq`.

### An `Eq` instance

Suppose we have two values of type `Option<string>` and that we want to compare them to check if their equal:

```typescript
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import { match, Option } from 'fp-ts/Option'

declare const o1: Option<string>
declare const o2: Option<string>

const result: boolean = pipe(
  o1,
  match(
    // onNone o1
    () =>
      pipe(
        o2,
        match(
          // onNone o2
          () => true,
          // onSome o2
          () => false
        )
      ),
    // onSome o1
    (s1) =>
      pipe(
        o2,
        match(
          // onNone o2
          () => false,
          // onSome o2
          (s2) => s1 === s2 // <= qui uso l'uguaglianza tra stringhe
        )
      )
  )
)
```

What if we had two values of type `Option<number>`? It would be pretty annoying to write the same code we just wrote above, the only difference afterall would be how we compare the two values contained in the `Option`.

Thus we can generalize the necessary code by requiring the user to provide an `Eq` instance for `A` and then derive an `Eq` instance for `Option<A>`.

In other words we can define a **combinator** `getEq`: given an `Eq<A>` this combinator will return an `Eq<Option<A>>`:

```typescript
import { Eq } from 'fp-ts/Eq'
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import { match, Option, none, some } from 'fp-ts/Option'

export const getEq = <A>(E: Eq<A>): Eq<Option<A>> => ({
  equals: (first, second) =>
    pipe(
      first,
      match(
        () =>
          pipe(
            second,
            match(
              () => true,
              () => false
            )
          ),
        (a1) =>
          pipe(
            second,
            match(
              () => false,
              (a2) => E.equals(a1, a2) // <= here I use the `A` equality
            )
          )
      )
    )
})

import * as S from 'fp-ts/string'

const EqOptionString = getEq(S.Eq)

console.log(EqOptionString.equals(none, none)) // => true
console.log(EqOptionString.equals(none, some('b'))) // => false
console.log(EqOptionString.equals(some('a'), none)) // => false
console.log(EqOptionString.equals(some('a'), some('b'))) // => false
console.log(EqOptionString.equals(some('a'), some('a'))) // => true
```

The best thing about being able to define an `Eq` instance for a type `Option<A>` is being able to leverage all of the combiners we've seen previously for `Eq`.

**Example**:

An `Eq` instance for the type `Option<readonly [string, number]>`:

```typescript
import { tuple } from 'fp-ts/Eq'
import * as N from 'fp-ts/number'
import { getEq, Option, some } from 'fp-ts/Option'
import * as S from 'fp-ts/string'

type MyTuple = readonly [string, number]

const EqMyTuple = tuple<MyTuple>(S.Eq, N.Eq)

const EqOptionMyTuple = getEq(EqMyTuple)

const o1: Option<MyTuple> = some(['a', 1])
const o2: Option<MyTuple> = some(['a', 2])
const o3: Option<MyTuple> = some(['b', 1])

console.log(EqOptionMyTuple.equals(o1, o1)) // => true
console.log(EqOptionMyTuple.equals(o1, o2)) // => false
console.log(EqOptionMyTuple.equals(o1, o3)) // => false
```

If we slightly modify the imports in the following snippet we can obtain a similar result for `Ord`:

```typescript
import * as N from 'fp-ts/number'
import { getOrd, Option, some } from 'fp-ts/Option'
import { tuple } from 'fp-ts/Ord'
import * as S from 'fp-ts/string'

type MyTuple = readonly [string, number]

const OrdMyTuple = tuple<MyTuple>(S.Ord, N.Ord)

const OrdOptionMyTuple = getOrd(OrdMyTuple)

const o1: Option<MyTuple> = some(['a', 1])
const o2: Option<MyTuple> = some(['a', 2])
const o3: Option<MyTuple> = some(['b', 1])

console.log(OrdOptionMyTuple.compare(o1, o1)) // => 0
console.log(OrdOptionMyTuple.compare(o1, o2)) // => -1
console.log(OrdOptionMyTuple.compare(o1, o3)) // => -1
```

### `Semigroup` and `Monoid` instances

Now, let's suppose we want to "merge" two different `Option<A>`s,: there are four different cases:

| x       | y       | concat(x, y) |
| ------- | ------- | ------------ |
| none    | none    | none         |
| some(a) | none    | none         |
| none    | some(a) | none         |
| some(a) | some(b) | ?            |

There's an issue in the last case, we need a recipe to "merge" two different `A`s.

If only we had such a recipe..Isn't that the job our old good friends `Semigroup`s!?

| x        | y        | concat(x, y)           |
| -------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| some(a1) | some(a2) | some(S.concat(a1, a2)) |

All we need to do is to require the user to provide a `Semigroup` instance for `A` and then derive a `Semigroup` instance for `Option<A>`.

```typescript
// the implementation is left as an exercise for the reader
declare const getApplySemigroup: <A>(S: Semigroup<A>) => Semigroup<Option<A>>
```

**Quiz**. Is it possible to add a neutral element to the previous semigroup to make it a monoid?

```typescript
// the implementation is left as an exercise for the reader
declare const getApplicativeMonoid: <A>(M: Monoid<A>) => Monoid<Option<A>>
```

It is possible to define a monoid instance for `Option<A>` that behaves like that:

| x        | y        | concat(x, y)           |
| -------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| none     | none     | none                   |
| some(a1) | none     | some(a1)               |
| none     | some(a2) | some(a2)               |
| some(a1) | some(a2) | some(S.concat(a1, a2)) |

```typescript
// the implementation is left as an exercise for the reader
declare const getMonoid: <A>(S: Semigroup<A>) => Monoid<Option<A>>
```

**Quiz**. What is the `empty` member for the monoid?

**Example**

Using `getMonoid` we can derive another two useful monoids:

(Monoid returning the left-most non-`None` value)

| x        | y        | concat(x, y) |
| -------- | -------- | ------------ |
| none     | none     | none         |
| some(a1) | none     | some(a1)     |
| none     | some(a2) | some(a2)     |
| some(a1) | some(a2) | some(a1)     |

```typescript
import { Monoid } from 'fp-ts/Monoid'
import { getMonoid, Option } from 'fp-ts/Option'
import { first } from 'fp-ts/Semigroup'

export const getFirstMonoid = <A = never>(): Monoid<Option<A>> =>
  getMonoid(first())
```

and its dual:

(Monoid returning the right-most non-`None` value)

| x        | y        | concat(x, y) |
| -------- | -------- | ------------ |
| none     | none     | none         |
| some(a1) | none     | some(a1)     |
| none     | some(a2) | some(a2)     |
| some(a1) | some(a2) | some(a2)     |

```typescript
import { Monoid } from 'fp-ts/Monoid'
import { getMonoid, Option } from 'fp-ts/Option'
import { last } from 'fp-ts/Semigroup'

export const getLastMonoid = <A = never>(): Monoid<Option<A>> =>
  getMonoid(last())
```

**Example**

`getLastMonoid` can be useful to manage optional values. Let's seen an example where we want to derive user settings for a text editor, in this case VSCode.

```typescript
import { Monoid, struct } from 'fp-ts/Monoid'
import { getMonoid, none, Option, some } from 'fp-ts/Option'
import { last } from 'fp-ts/Semigroup'

/** VSCode settings */
interface Settings {
  /** Controls the font family */
  readonly fontFamily: Option<string>
  /** Controls the font size in pixels */
  readonly fontSize: Option<number>
  /** Limit the width of the minimap to render at most a certain number of columns. */
  readonly maxColumn: Option<number>
}

const monoidSettings: Monoid<Settings> = struct({
  fontFamily: getMonoid(last()),
  fontSize: getMonoid(last()),
  maxColumn: getMonoid(last())
})

const workspaceSettings: Settings = {
  fontFamily: some('Courier'),
  fontSize: none,
  maxColumn: some(80)
}

const userSettings: Settings = {
  fontFamily: some('Fira Code'),
  fontSize: some(12),
  maxColumn: none
}

/** userSettings overrides workspaceSettings */
console.log(monoidSettings.concat(workspaceSettings, userSettings))
/*
{ fontFamily: some("Fira Code"),
  fontSize: some(12),
  maxColumn: some(80) }
*/
```

**Quiz**. Suppose VSCode cannot manage more than `80` columns per row, how could we modify the definition of `monoidSettings` to take that into account?

### The `Either` type

We have seen how the `Option` data type can be used to handle partial functions, which often represent computations than can fail or throw exceptions.

This data type might be limiting in some use cases tho. While in the case of success we get `Some<A>` which contains information of type `A`, the other member, `None` does not carry any data. We know it failed, but we don't know the reason.

In order to fix this we simply need to another data type to represent failure, we'll call it `Left<E>`. We'll also replace the `Some<A>` type with the `Right<A>`.

```typescript
// represents a failure
interface Left<E> {
  readonly _tag: 'Left'
  readonly left: E
}

// represents a success
interface Right<A> {
  readonly _tag: 'Right'
  readonly right: A
}

type Either<E, A> = Left<E> | Right<A>
```

Constructors and pattern matching:

```typescript
const left = <E, A>(left: E): Either<E, A> => ({ _tag: 'Left', left })

const right = <A, E>(right: A): Either<E, A> => ({ _tag: 'Right', right })

const match = <E, R, A>(onLeft: (left: E) => R, onRight: (right: A) => R) => (
  fa: Either<E, A>
): R => {
  switch (fa._tag) {
    case 'Left':
      return onLeft(fa.left)
    case 'Right':
      return onRight(fa.right)
  }
}
```

Let's get back to the previous callback example:

```typescript
declare function readFile(
  path: string,
  callback: (err?: Error, data?: string) => void
): void

readFile('./myfile', (err, data) => {
  let message: string
  if (err !== undefined) {
    message = `Error: ${err.message}`
  } else if (data !== undefined) {
    message = `Data: ${data.trim()}`
  } else {
    // should never happen
    message = 'The impossible happened'
  }
  console.log(message)
})
```

we can change it's signature to:

```typescript
declare function readFile(
  path: string,
  callback: (result: Either<Error, string>) => void
): void
```

and consume the API in such way:

```typescript
readFile('./myfile', (e) =>
  pipe(
    e,
    match(
      (err) => `Error: ${err.message}`,
      (data) => `Data: ${data.trim()}`
    ),
    console.log
  )
)
```

# Category theory

We have seen how a founding pillar of functional programming is **composition**.

> And how do we solve problems? We decompose bigger problems into smaller problems. If the smaller problems are still too big, we decompose them further, and so on. Finally, we write code that solves all the small problems. And then comes the essence of programming: we compose those pieces of code to create solutions to larger problems. Decomposition wouldn't make sense if we weren't able to put the pieces back together. - Bartosz Milewski

But what does it means exactly? How can we state whether two things _compose_? And how can we say if two things compose _well_?

> Entities are composable if we can easily and generally combine their behaviours in some way without having to modify the entities being combined. I think of composability as being the key ingredient necessary for achieving reuse, and for achieving a combinatorial expansion of what is succinctly expressible in a programming model. - Paul Chiusano

We've briefly mentioned how a program written in functional styles tends to resemble a pipeline:

```typescript
const program = pipe(
  input,
  f1, // pure function
  f2, // pure function
  f3, // pure function
  ...
)
```

But how simple it is to code in such a style? Let's try:

```typescript
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as RA from 'fp-ts/ReadonlyArray'

const double = (n: number): number => n * 2

/**
 * Given a ReadonlyArray<number> the program doubles the first element and returns it
 */
const program = (input: ReadonlyArray<number>): number =>
  pipe(
    input,
    RA.head, // compilation error! Type 'Option<number>' is not assignable to type 'number'
    double
  )
```

Why do I get a compilation error? Because `head` and `double` do not compose.

```typescript
head: (as: ReadonlyArray<number>) => Option<number>
double: (n: number) => number
```

`head`'s codomain is not included in `double`'s domain.

Looks like our goal to program using pure functions is over..Or is it?

We need to be able to refer to some **rigorous theory**, one able to answer such fundamental questions.

We need to refer to a **formal definition** of composability.

Luckily, for the last 70 years ago, a large number of researchers, members of the oldest and largest humanity's open source project (mathematics) occupied itself with developing a theory dedicated to composability: **category theory**, a branch of mathematics founded by Saunders Mac Lane along Samuel Eilenberg (1945).

</div>

We'll see in the following chapters how a category can form the basis for:

- a model for a generic **programming language**
- a model for the concept of **composition**

## Definition

The definition of a category, even though it isn't really complex, is a bit long, thus I'll split it in two parts:

- the first is merely technical (we need to define its constituents)
- the second one will be more relevant to what we care for: a notion of composition

### Part I (Constituents)

A category is a pair of `(Objects, Morphisms)` where:

- `Objects` is a collection of **objects**
- `Morphisms` is a collection of **morphisms** (also called "arrows") between objects

**참고**. The term "object" has nothing to do with the concept of "objects" in programming. Just think about those "objects" as black boxes we can't inspect, or simple placeholders useful to define the various morphisms.

Every morphism `f` owns a source object `A` and a target object `B`.

In every morphism, both `A` and `B` are members of `Objects`. We write `f: A ⟼ B` and we say that "f is a morphism from A to B".

<img src="images/morphism.png" width="300" alt="A morphism" />

**참고**. For simplicity, from now on, I'll use labels only for objects, skipping the circles.

**Part II (Composition)**

There is an operation, `∘`, called "composition", such as the following properties hold true:

- (**composition of morphisms**) every time we have two morphisms `f: A ⟼ B` and `g: B ⟼ C` in `Morphisms` then there has to be a third morphism `g ∘ f: A ⟼ C` in `Morphisms` which is the _composition_ of `f` and `g`

<img src="images/composition.png" width="300" alt="composition" />

- (**associativity**) if `f: A ⟼ B`, `g: B ⟼ C` and `h: C ⟼ D` then `h ∘ (g ∘ f) = (h ∘ g) ∘ f`

<img src="images/associativity.png" width="500" alt="associativity" />

- (**identity**) for every object `X`, there is a morphism `identity: X ⟼ X` called _identity morphism_ of `X`, such as for every morphism `f: A ⟼ X` and `g: X ⟼ B`, the following equation holds true `identity ∘ f = f` and `g ∘ identity = g`.

<img src="images/identity.png" width="300" alt="identity" />

**Example**

<img src="images/category.png" width="300" alt="a simple category" />

This category is very simple, there are three objects and six morphisms (1<sub>A</sub>, 1<sub>B</sub>, 1<sub>C</sub> are the identity morphisms for `A`, `B`, `C`).

## Modeling programming languages with categories

A category can be seen as a simplified model for a **typed programming language**, where:

- objects are **types**
- morphisms are **functions**
- `∘` is the usual **function composition**

The following diagram:

<img src="images/category.png" width="300" alt="a simple programming language" />

can be seen as an imaginary (and simple) programming language with just three types and six functions

Example given:

- `A = string`
- `B = number`
- `C = boolean`
- `f = string => number`
- `g = number => boolean`
- `g ∘ f = string => boolean`

The implementation could be something like:

```typescript
const idA = (s: string): string => s

const idB = (n: number): string => n

const idC = (b: boolean): boolean => b

const f = (s: string): number => s.length

const g = (n: number): boolean => n > 2

// gf = g ∘ f
const gf = (s: string): boolean => g(f(s))
```

## A category for TypeScript

We can define a category, let's call it _TS_, as a simplified model of the TypeScript language, where:

- **objects** are all the possible TypeScript types: `string`, `number`, `ReadonlyArray<string>`, etc...
- **morphisms** are all TypeScript functions: `(a: A) => B`, `(b: B) => C`, ... where `A`, `B`, `C`, ... are TypeScript types
- the **identity morphisms** are all encoded in a single polymorphic function `const identity = <A>(a: A): A => a`
- **morphism's composition** is the usual function composition (which we know to be associative)

As a model of TypeScript, the _TS_ category may seem a bit limited: no loops, no `if`s, there's _almost_ nothing... that being said that simplified model is rich enough to help us reach our goal: to reason about a well-defined notion of composition.

## Composition's core problem

In the _TS_ category we can compose two generic functions `f: (a: A) => B` and `g: (c: C) => D` as long as `C = B`

```typescript
function flow<A, B, C>(f: (a: A) => B, g: (b: B) => C): (a: A) => C {
  return (a) => g(f(a))
}

function pipe<A, B, C>(a: A, f: (a: A) => B, g: (b: B) => C): C {
  return flow(f, g)(a)
}
```

But what happens if `B != C`? How can we compose two such functions? Should we give up?

In the next section we'll see under which conditions such a composition is possible.

**Spoiler**

- to compose `f: (a: A) => B` with `g: (b: B) => C` we use our usual function composition
- to compose `f: (a: A) => F<B>` with `g: (b: B) => C` we need a **functor** instance for `F`
- to compose `f: (a: A) => F<B>` with `g: (b: B, c: C) => D` we need an **applicative functor** instance for `F`
- to compose `f: (a: A) => F<B>` with `g: (b: B) => F<C>` we need a **monad** instance for `F`

<img src="images/spoiler.png" width="900" alt="The four composition recipes" />

The problem we started with at the beginning of this chapter corresponds to the second situation, where `F` is the `Option` type:

```typescript
// A = ReadonlyArray<number>, B = number, F = Option
head: (as: ReadonlyArray<number>) => Option<number>
double: (n: number) => number
```

To solve it, the next chapter will talk about functors.

# Functors

In the last section we've spoken about the _TS_ category (the TypeScript category) and about function composition's core problem:

> How can we compose two generic functions `f: (a: A) => B` and `g: (c: C) => D`?

Why is finding solutions to this problem so important?

Because, if it is true that categories can be used to model programming languages, morphisms (functions in the _TS_ category) can be used to model **programs**.

Thus, solving this abstract problem means finding a concrete way of **composing programs in a generic way**. And _that_ is really interesting for us developers, isn't it?

## Functions as programs

If we want to model programs with functions we need to tackle an issue immediately:

> How is it possible to model a program that produces side effects with a pure function?

The answer is to model side effects through **effects**, meaning types that **represent** side effects.

Let's see two possible techniques to do so in JavaScript:

- define a DSL (domain specific language) for effects
- use a _thunk_

The first technique, using a DSL, means modifying a program like:

```typescript
function log(message: string): void {
  console.log(message) // side effect
}
```

changing its codomain to make the function return a **description** of the side effect:

```typescript
type DSL = ... // sum type of every possible effect handled by the system

function log(message: string): DSL {
  return {
    type: "log",
    message
  }
}
```

**Quiz**. Is the freshly defined `log` function really pure? Actually `log('foo') !== log('foo')`!

This technique requires a way to combine effects and the definition of an interpreter able to execute the side effects when launching the final program.

The second technique, way simpler in TypeScript, is to enclose the computation in a _thunk_:

```typescript
// a thunk representing a synchronous side effect
type IO<A> = () => A

const log = (message: string): IO<void> => {
  return () => console.log(message) // returns a thunk
}
```

The `log` program, once executed, won't cause immediately a side effect, but returns **a value representing the computation** (also known as _action_).

```typescript
import { IO } from 'fp-ts/IO'

export const log = (message: string): IO<void> => {
  return () => console.log(message) // returns a thunk
}

export const main = log('hello!')
// there's nothing in the output at this point
// because `main` is only an inert value
// representing the computation

main()
// only when launching the program I will see the result
```

In functional programming there's a tendency to shove side effects (under the form of effects) to the border of the system (the `main` function) where they are executed by an interpreter obtaining the following schema:

> system = pure core + imperative shell

In _purely functional_ languages (like Haskell, PureScript or Elm) this division is strict and clear and imposed by the very languages.

Even with this thunk technique (the same technique used in `fp-ts`) we need a way to combine effects, which brings us back to our goal of composing programs in a generic way, let's see how.

We first need a bit of (informal) terminology: we'll call **pure program** a function with the following signature:

```typescript
(a: A) => B
```

Such a signature models a program that takes an input of type `A` and returns a result of type `B` without any effect.

**Example**

The `len` program:

```typescript
const len = (s: string): number => s.length
```

We'll call an **effectful program** a function with the following signature:

```typescript
(a: A) => F<B>
```

Such a signature models a program that takes an input of type `A` and returns a result of type `B` together with an **effect** `F`, where `F` is some sort of type constructor.

Let's recall that a [type constructor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_constructor) is an `n`-ary type operator that takes as argument one or more types and returns another type. We have seen examples of such constructors as `Option`, `ReadonlyArray`, `Either`.

**Example**

The `head` program:

```typescript
import { Option, some, none } from 'fp-ts/Option'

const head = <A>(as: ReadonlyArray<A>): Option<A> =>
  as.length === 0 ? none : some(as[0])
```

is a program with an `Option` effect.

When we talk about effects we are interested in `n`-ary type constructors where `n >= 1`, example given:

| Type constructor   | Effect (interpretation)                        |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `ReadonlyArray<A>` | a non deterministic computation                |
| `Option<A>`        | a computation that may fail                    |
| `Either<E, A>`     | a computation that may fail                    |
| `IO<A>`            | a synchronous computation that **never fails** |
| `Task<A>`          | an asynchronous computation **never fails**    |
| `Reader<R, A>`     | reading from an environment                    |

where

```typescript
// a thunk returning a `Promise`
type Task<A> = () => Promise<A>
```

```typescript
// `R` represents an "environment" needed for the computation
// (we can "read" from it) and `A` is the result
type Reader<R, A> = (r: R) => A
```

Let's get back to our core problem:

> How do we compose two generic functions `f: (a: A) => B` e `g: (c: C) => D`?

With our current set of rules this general problem is not solvable. We need to add some _boundaries_ to `B` and `C`.

We already know that if `B = C` then the solution is the usual function composition.

```typescript
function flow<A, B, C>(f: (a: A) => B, g: (b: B) => C): (a: A) => C {
  return (a) => g(f(a))
}
```

But what about other cases?

## A boundary that leads to functors

Let's consider the following boundary: `B = F<C>` for some type constructor `F`, we have the following situation:

- `f: (a: A) => F<B>` is an effectful program
- `g: (b: B) => C` is a pure program

In order to compose `f` with `g` we need to find a procedure that allows us to derive a function `g` from a function `(b: B) => C` to a function `(fb: F<B>) => F<C>` in order to use the usual function composition (this way the codomain of `f` would be the same of the new function's domain).

<img src="images/map.png" width="500" alt="map" />

We have mutated the original problem in a new one: can we find a function, let's call it `map`, that operates this way?

Let's see some practical example:

**Example** (`F = ReadonlyArray`)

```typescript
import { flow, pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'

// transforms functions `B -> C` to functions `ReadonlyArray<B> -> ReadonlyArray<C>`
const map = <B, C>(g: (b: B) => C) => (
  fb: ReadonlyArray<B>
): ReadonlyArray<C> => fb.map(g)

// -------------------
// usage example
// -------------------

interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
  readonly followers: ReadonlyArray<User>
}

const getFollowers = (user: User): ReadonlyArray<User> => user.followers
const getName = (user: User): string => user.name

// getFollowersNames: User -> ReadonlyArray<string>
const getFollowersNames = flow(getFollowers, map(getName))

// let's use `pipe` instead of `flow`...
export const getFollowersNames2 = (user: User) =>
  pipe(user, getFollowers, map(getName))

const user: User = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Ruth R. Gonzalez',
  followers: [
    { id: 2, name: 'Terry R. Emerson', followers: [] },
    { id: 3, name: 'Marsha J. Joslyn', followers: [] }
  ]
}

console.log(getFollowersNames(user)) // => [ 'Terry R. Emerson', 'Marsha J. Joslyn' ]
```

**Example** (`F = Option`)

```typescript
import { flow } from 'fp-ts/function'
import { none, Option, match, some } from 'fp-ts/Option'

// transforms functions `B -> C` to functions `Option<B> -> Option<C>`
const map = <B, C>(g: (b: B) => C): ((fb: Option<B>) => Option<C>) =>
  match(
    () => none,
    (b) => {
      const c = g(b)
      return some(c)
    }
  )

// -------------------
// usage example
// -------------------

import * as RA from 'fp-ts/ReadonlyArray'

const head: (input: ReadonlyArray<number>) => Option<number> = RA.head
const double = (n: number): number => n * 2

// getDoubleHead: ReadonlyArray<number> -> Option<number>
const getDoubleHead = flow(head, map(double))

console.log(getDoubleHead([1, 2, 3])) // => some(2)
console.log(getDoubleHead([])) // => none
```

**Example** (`F = IO`)

```typescript
import { flow } from 'fp-ts/function'
import { IO } from 'fp-ts/IO'

// transforms functions `B -> C` to functions `IO<B> -> IO<C>`
const map = <B, C>(g: (b: B) => C) => (fb: IO<B>): IO<C> => () => {
  const b = fb()
  return g(b)
}

// -------------------
// usage example
// -------------------

interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
}

// a dummy in-memory database
const database: Record<number, User> = {
  1: { id: 1, name: 'Ruth R. Gonzalez' },
  2: { id: 2, name: 'Terry R. Emerson' },
  3: { id: 3, name: 'Marsha J. Joslyn' }
}

const getUser = (id: number): IO<User> => () => database[id]
const getName = (user: User): string => user.name

// getUserName: number -> IO<string>
const getUserName = flow(getUser, map(getName))

console.log(getUserName(1)()) // => Ruth R. Gonzalez
```

**Example** (`F = Task`)

```typescript
import { flow } from 'fp-ts/function'
import { Task } from 'fp-ts/Task'

// transforms functions `B -> C` into functions `Task<B> -> Task<C>`
const map = <B, C>(g: (b: B) => C) => (fb: Task<B>): Task<C> => () => {
  const promise = fb()
  return promise.then(g)
}

// -------------------

interface User {

const getName = (user: User): string => user.name

// getUserName: number -> Task<string>
const getUserName = flow(getUser, map(getName))

getUserName(1)().then(console.log) // => Ruth R. Gonzalez

import { flow } from 'fp-ts/function'
import { Reader } from 'fp-ts/Reader'

// transforms functions `B -> C` into functions `Reader<R, B> -> Reader<R, C>`
const map = <B, C>(g: (b: B) => C) => <R>(fb: Reader<R, B>): Reader<R, C> => (
  r
) => {
  const b = fb(r)
  return g(b)
}

// -------------------
// usage example
// -------------------

interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
}

interface Env {
  // a dummy in-memory database
  readonly database: Record<string, User>
}

const getUser = (id: number): Reader<Env, User> => (env) => env.database[id]
const getName = (user: User): string => user.name

// getUserName: number -> Reader<Env, string>
const getUserName = flow(getUser, map(getName))

console.log(
  getUserName(1)({
    database: {
      1: { id: 1, name: 'Ruth R. Gonzalez' },
      2: { id: 2, name: 'Terry R. Emerson' },
      3: { id: 3, name: 'Marsha J. Joslyn' }
    }
  })
) // => Ruth R. Gonzalez
```

More generally, when a type constructor `F` admits a `map` function, we say it admits a **functor instance**.

From a mathematical point of view, functors are **maps between categories** that preserve the structure of the category, meaning they preserve the identity morphisms and the composition operation.

Since categories are pairs of objects and morphisms, a functor too is a pair of two things:

- a **map between objects** that binds every object `X` in _C_ to an object in _D_.
- a **map between morphisms** that binds every morphism `f` in _C_ to a morphism `map(f)` in _D_.

where _C_ e _D_ are two categories (aka two programming languages).

<img src="images/functor.png" width="500" alt="functor" />

Even though a map between two different programming languages is a fascinating idea, we're more interested in a map where _C_ and _D_ are the same (the _TS_ category). In that case we're talking about **endofunctors** (from the greek "endo" meaning "inside", "internal").

From now on, unless specified differently, when we write "functor" we mean an endofunctor in the _TS_ category.

Now we know the practical side of functors, let's see the formal definition.

### Definition

A functor is a pair `(F, map)` where:

- `F` is an `n`-ary (`n >= 1`) type constructor mapping every type `X` in a type `F<X>` (**map between objects**)
- `map` is a function with the following signature:

```typescript
map: <A, B>(f: (a: A) => B) => ((fa: F<A>) => F<B>)
```

that maps every function `f: (a: A) => B` in a function `map(f): (fa: F<A>) => F<B>` (**map between morphism**)

The following properties have to hold true:

- `map(1`<sub>X</sub>`)` = `1`<sub>F(X)</sub> (**identities go to identities**)
- `map(g ∘ f) = map(g) ∘ map(f)` (**the image of a composition is the composition of its images**)

The second law allows to refactor and optimize the following computation:

```typescript
import { flow, increment, pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import { map } from 'fp-ts/ReadonlyArray'

const double = (n: number): number => n * 2

// iterates array twice
console.log(pipe([1, 2, 3], map(double), map(increment))) // => [ 3, 5, 7 ]

// single iteration
console.log(pipe([1, 2, 3], map(flow(double, increment)))) // => [ 3, 5, 7 ]
```

## Functors and functional error handling

Functors have a positive impact on functional error handling, let's see a practical example:

```typescript
declare const doSomethingWithIndex: (index: number) => string

export const program = (ns: ReadonlyArray<number>): string => {
  // -1 indicates that no element has been found
  const i = ns.findIndex((n) => n > 0)
  if (i !== -1) {
    return doSomethingWithIndex(i)
  }
  throw new Error('cannot find a positive number')
}
```

Using the native `findIndex` API we are forced to use an `if` branch to test whether we have a result different than `-1`. If we forget to do so, the value `-1` could be unintentionally passed as input to `doSomethingWithIndex`.

Let's see how easier it is to obtain the same behavior using `Option` and its functor instance:

```typescript
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import { map, Option } from 'fp-ts/Option'
import { findIndex } from 'fp-ts/ReadonlyArray'

declare const doSomethingWithIndex: (index: number) => string

export const program = (ns: ReadonlyArray<number>): Option<string> =>
  pipe(
    ns,
    findIndex((n) => n > 0),
    map(doSomethingWithIndex)
  )
```

Practically, using `Option`, we're always in front of the `happy path`, error handing happens behind the scenes thanks to `map`.

**Demo** (optional)

[`04_functor.ts`](src/04_functor.ts)

**Quiz**. `Task<A>` represents an asynchronous call that always succeed, how can we model a computation that can fail instead?

## Functors compose

Functors compose, meaning that given two functors `F` and `G` then the composition `F<G<A>>` is still a functor and the `map` of this composition is the composition of the `map`s.

**Example** (`F = Task`, `G = Option`)

```typescript
import { flow } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as O from 'fp-ts/Option'
import * as T from 'fp-ts/Task'

type TaskOption<A> = T.Task<O.Option<A>>

export const map: <A, B>(
  f: (a: A) => B
) => (fa: TaskOption<A>) => TaskOption<B> = flow(O.map, T.map)

// -------------------
// usage example
// -------------------

interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
}

// a dummy remote database
const database: Record<number, User> = {
  1: { id: 1, name: 'Ruth R. Gonzalez' },
  2: { id: 2, name: 'Terry R. Emerson' },
  3: { id: 3, name: 'Marsha J. Joslyn' }
}

const getUser = (id: number): TaskOption<User> => () =>
  Promise.resolve(O.fromNullable(database[id]))
const getName = (user: User): string => user.name

// getUserName: number -> TaskOption<string>
const getUserName = flow(getUser, map(getName))

getUserName(1)().then(console.log) // => some('Ruth R. Gonzalez')
getUserName(4)().then(console.log) // => none
```

## Contravariant Functors

In the previous section we haven't been completely thorough with our definitions. What we have seen in the previous section and called "functors" should be more properly called **covariant functors**.

In this section we'll see another variant of the functor concept, **contravariant** functors.

The definition of a contravariant functor is pretty much the same of the covariant one, except for the signature of its fundamental operation, which is called `contramap` rather than `map`.

<img src="images/contramap.png" width="300" alt="contramap" />

**Example**

```typescript
import { map } from 'fp-ts/Option'
import { contramap } from 'fp-ts/Eq'

type User = {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
}

const getId = (_: User): number => _.id

// the way `map` operates...
// const getIdOption: (fa: Option<User>) => Option<number>
const getIdOption = map(getId)

// the way `contramap` operates...
// const getIdEq: (fa: Eq<number>) => Eq<User>
const getIdEq = contramap(getId)

import * as N from 'fp-ts/number'

const EqID = getIdEq(N.Eq)

/*

In the `Eq` chapter we saw:

const EqID: Eq<User> = pipe(
  N.Eq,
  contramap((_: User) => _.id)
)
*/
```

## Functors in `fp-ts`

How do we define a functor instance in `fp-ts`? Let's see some example.

The following interface represents the model of some result we get by calling some HTTP API:

```typescript
interface Response<A> {
  url: string
  status: number
  headers: Record<string, string>
  body: A
}
```

Please note that since `body` is parametric, this makes `Response` a good candidate to find a functor instance given that `Response` is a an `n`-ary type constructor with `n >= 1` (a necessary condition).

To define a functor instance for `Response` we need to define a `map` function along some [technical details](https://gcanti.github.io/fp-ts/recipes/HKT.html) required by `fp-ts`.

```typescript
// `Response.ts` module

import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import { Functor1 } from 'fp-ts/Functor'

declare module 'fp-ts/HKT' {
  interface URItoKind<A> {
    readonly Response: Response<A>
  }
}

export interface Response<A> {
  readonly url: string
  readonly status: number
  readonly headers: Record<string, string>
  readonly body: A
}

export const map = <A, B>(f: (a: A) => B) => (
  fa: Response<A>
): Response<B> => ({
  ...fa,
  body: f(fa.body)
})

// functor instance for `Response<A>`
export const Functor: Functor1<'Response'> = {
  URI: 'Response',
  map: (fa, f) => pipe(fa, map(f))
}
```

## Do functors solve the general problem?

Not yet. Functors allow us to compose an effectful program `f` with a pure program `g`, but `g` has to be a **unary** function, accepting one single argument. What happens if `g` takes two or more arguments?

| Program f | Program g               | Composition  |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ------------ |
| pure      | pure                    | `g ∘ f`      |
| effectful | pure (unary)            | `map(g) ∘ f` |
| effectful | pure (`n`-ary, `n > 1`) | ?            |

To manage this circumstance we need something _more_, in the next chapter we'll see another important abstraction in functional programming: **applicative functors**.

# Applicative functors

In the section regarding functors we've seen that we can compose an effectful program `f: (a: A) => F<B>` with a pure one `g: (b: B) => C` through the transformation of `g` to a function `map(g): (fb: F<B>) => F<C>` (if and only if `F` admits a functor instance).

| Program f | Program g    | Composition  |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| pure      | pure         | `g ∘ f`      |
| effectful | pure (unary) | `map(g) ∘ f` |

But `g` has to be unary, it can only accept a single argument as input. What happens if `g` accepts two arguments? Can we still transform `g` using only the functor instance?

## Currying

First of all we need to model a function that accepts two arguments of type `B` and `C` (we can use a tuple for this) and returns a value of type `D`:

```typescript
g: (b: B, c: C) => D
```

We can rewrite `g` using a technique called **currying**.

> Currying is the technique of translating the evaluation of a function that takes multiple arguments into evaluating a sequence of functions, **each with a single argument**. For example, a function that takes two arguments, one from `B` and one from `C`, and produces outputs in `D`, by currying is translated into a function that takes a single argument from `C` and produces as outputs functions from `B` to `C`.

(source: [currying on wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying))

Thus, through currying, we can rewrite `g` as:

```typescript
g: (b: B) => (c: C) => D
```

**Example**

```typescript
interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
  readonly followers: ReadonlyArray<User>
}

const addFollower = (follower: User, user: User): User => ({
  ...user,
  followers: [...user.followers, follower]
})
```

Let's refactor `addFollower` through currying

```typescript
interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
  readonly followers: ReadonlyArray<User>
}

const addFollower = (follower: User) => (user: User): User => ({
  ...user,
  followers: [...user.followers, follower]
})

// -------------------
// usage example
// -------------------

const user: User = { id: 1, name: 'Ruth R. Gonzalez', followers: [] }
const follower: User = { id: 3, name: 'Marsha J. Joslyn', followers: [] }

console.log(addFollower(follower)(user))
/*
{
  id: 1,
  name: 'Ruth R. Gonzalez',
  followers: [ { id: 3, name: 'Marsha J. Joslyn', followers: [] } ]
}
*/
```

## The `ap` operation

Suppose that:

- we do not have a `follower` but only his `id`
- we do not have a `user` but only his `id`
- that we have an API `fetchUser` which, given an `id`, queries an endpoint that returns the corresponding `User`

```typescript
import * as T from 'fp-ts/Task'

interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
  readonly followers: ReadonlyArray<User>
}

const addFollower = (follower: User) => (user: User): User => ({
  ...user,
  followers: [...user.followers, follower]
})

declare const fetchUser: (id: number) => T.Task<User>

const userId = 1
const followerId = 3

const result = addFollower(fetchUser(followerId))(fetchUser(userId)) // does not compile
```

I can't use `addFollower` anymore! How can we proceed?

If only we had a function with the following signature:

```typescript
declare const addFollowerAsync: (
  follower: T.Task<User>
) => (user: T.Task<User>) => T.Task<User>
```

we could proceed with ease:

```typescript
import * as T from 'fp-ts/Task'

interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
  readonly followers: ReadonlyArray<User>
}

declare const fetchUser: (id: number) => T.Task<User>

declare const addFollowerAsync: (
  follower: T.Task<User>
) => (user: T.Task<User>) => T.Task<User>

const userId = 1
const followerId = 3

// const result: T.Task<User>
const result = addFollowerAsync(fetchUser(followerId))(fetchUser(userId)) // now compiles
```

We can obviously implement `addFollowerAsyn` manually, but is it possible instead to find a transformation which starting with a function like `addFollower: (follower: User) => (user: User): User` returns a function like `addFollowerAsync: (follower: Task<User>) => (user: Task<User>) => Task<User>`?

More generally what we would like to have is a transformation, call it `liftA2`, which beginning with a function `g: (b: B) => (c: C) => D` returns a function with the following signature:

```typescript
liftA2(g): (fb: F<B>) => (fc: F<C>) => F<D>
```

<img src="images/liftA2.png" width="500" alt="liftA2" />

How can we obtain it? Given that `g` is now a unary function, we can leverage the functor instance and the good old `map`:

```typescript
map(g): (fb: F<B>) => F<(c: C) => D>
```

<img src="images/liftA2-first-step.png" width="500" alt="liftA2 (first step)" />

Now we are blocked: there's no legal operation the functor instance provides us to "unpack" the type `F<(c: C) => D>` into `(fc: F<C>) => F<D>`.

We need to introduce a new operation `ap` which realizes this unpacking:

```typescript
declare const ap: <A>(fa: Task<A>) => <B>(fab: Task<(a: A) => B>) => Task<B>
```

**참고**. Why is it names "ap"? Because it can be seen like some sort of function application.

```typescript
// `apply` applies a function to a value
declare const apply: <A>(a: A) => <B>(f: (a: A) => B) => B

declare const ap: <A>(a: Task<A>) => <B>(f: Task<(a: A) => B>) => Task<B>
// `ap` applies a function wrapped into an effect to a value wrapped into an effect
```

Now that we have `ap` we can define `liftA2`:

```typescript
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as T from 'fp-ts/Task'

const liftA2 = <B, C, D>(g: (b: B) => (c: C) => D) => (fb: T.Task<B>) => (
  fc: T.Task<C>
): T.Task<D> => pipe(fb, T.map(g), T.ap(fc))

interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
  readonly followers: ReadonlyArray<User>
}

const addFollower = (follower: User) => (user: User): User => ({
  ...user,
  followers: [...user.followers, follower]
})

// const addFollowerAsync: (fb: T.Task<User>) => (fc: T.Task<User>) => T.Task<User>
const addFollowerAsync = liftA2(addFollower)
```

and finally, we can compose `fetchUser` with the previous result:

```typescript
import { flow, pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as T from 'fp-ts/Task'

const liftA2 = <B, C, D>(g: (b: B) => (c: C) => D) => (fb: T.Task<B>) => (
  fc: T.Task<C>
): T.Task<D> => pipe(fb, T.map(g), T.ap(fc))

interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
  readonly followers: ReadonlyArray<User>
}

const addFollower = (follower: User) => (user: User): User => ({
  ...user,
  followers: [...user.followers, follower]
})

declare const fetchUser: (id: number) => T.Task<User>

// const program: (id: number) => (fc: T.Task<User>) => T.Task<User>
const program = flow(fetchUser, liftA2(addFollower))

const userId = 1
const followerId = 3

// const result: T.Task<User>
const result = program(followerId)(fetchUser(userId))
```

We have found a standard procedure to compose two functions `f: (a: A) => F<B>`, `g: (b: B, c: C) => D`:

1. we transform `g` through currying in a function `g: (b: B) => (c: C) => D`
2. we define the `ap` function for the effect `F` (library function)
3. we define the utility function `liftA2` for the effect `F` (library function)
4. we obtain the composition `flow(f, liftA2(g))`

Let's see how's the `ap` operation implemented for some of the type constructors we've already seen:

**Example** (`F = ReadonlyArray`)

```typescript
import { increment, pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'

const ap = <A>(fa: ReadonlyArray<A>) => <B>(
  fab: ReadonlyArray<(a: A) => B>
): ReadonlyArray<B> => {
  const out: Array<B> = []
  for (const f of fab) {
    for (const a of fa) {
      out.push(f(a))
    }
  }
  return out
}

const double = (n: number): number => n * 2

pipe([double, increment], ap([1, 2, 3]), console.log) // => [ 2, 4, 6, 2, 3, 4 ]
```

**Example** (`F = Option`)

```typescript
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as O from 'fp-ts/Option'

const ap = <A>(fa: O.Option<A>) => <B>(
  fab: O.Option<(a: A) => B>
): O.Option<B> =>
  pipe(
    fab,
    O.match(
      () => O.none,
      (f) =>
        pipe(
          fa,
          O.match(
            () => O.none,
            (a) => O.some(f(a))
          )
        )
    )
  )

const double = (n: number): number => n * 2

pipe(O.some(double), ap(O.some(1)), console.log) // => some(2)
pipe(O.some(double), ap(O.none), console.log) // => none
pipe(O.none, ap(O.some(1)), console.log) // => none
pipe(O.none, ap(O.none), console.log) // => none
```

**Example** (`F = IO`)

```typescript
import { IO } from 'fp-ts/IO'

const ap = <A>(fa: IO<A>) => <B>(fab: IO<(a: A) => B>): IO<B> => () => {
  const f = fab()
  const a = fa()
  return f(a)
}
```

**Example** (`F = Task`)

```typescript
import { Task } from 'fp-ts/Task'

const ap = <A>(fa: Task<A>) => <B>(fab: Task<(a: A) => B>): Task<B> => () =>
  Promise.all([fab(), fa()]).then(([f, a]) => f(a))
```

**Example** (`F = Reader`)

```typescript
import { Reader } from 'fp-ts/Reader'

const ap = <R, A>(fa: Reader<R, A>) => <B>(
  fab: Reader<R, (a: A) => B>
): Reader<R, B> => (r) => {
  const f = fab(r)
  const a = fa(r)
  return f(a)
}
```

We've seen how with `ap` we can manage functions with two parameters, but what happens with functions that take **three** parameters? Do we need _yet another abstraction_?

Good news is no, `map` and `ap` are sufficient:

```typescript
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as T from 'fp-ts/Task'

const liftA3 = <B, C, D, E>(f: (b: B) => (c: C) => (d: D) => E) => (
  fb: T.Task<B>
) => (fc: T.Task<C>) => (fd: T.Task<D>): T.Task<E> =>
  pipe(fb, T.map(f), T.ap(fc), T.ap(fd))

const liftA4 = <B, C, D, E, F>(
  f: (b: B) => (c: C) => (d: D) => (e: E) => F
) => (fb: T.Task<B>) => (fc: T.Task<C>) => (fd: T.Task<D>) => (
  fe: T.Task<E>
): T.Task<F> => pipe(fb, T.map(f), T.ap(fc), T.ap(fd), T.ap(fe))

// etc...
```

Now we cam update ore "composition table":

| Program f | Program g     | Composition     |
| --------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| pure      | pure          | `g ∘ f`         |
| effectful | pure (unary)  | `map(g) ∘ f`    |
| effectful | pure, `n`-ary | `liftAn(g) ∘ f` |

## The `of` operation

Now we know that given two function `f: (a: A) => F<B>`, `g: (b: B, c: C) => D` we can obtain the composition `h`:

```typescript
h: (a: A) => (fb: F<B>) => F<D>
```

To execute `h` we need a new value of type `A` and a value of type `F<B>`.

But what happens if, instead of having a value of type `F<B>`, for the second parameter `fb` we only have a value of type `B`?

It would be helpful to have an operation which can transform a value of type `B` in a value of type `F<B>` in order to use `h`.

Let's introduce such operation, called `of` (other synonyms: **pure**, **return**):

```typescript
declare const of: <B>(b: B) => F<B>
```

In literature the term **applicative functors** is used for the type constructors which admith _both_ the `ap` and `of` operations.

Let's see how `of` is defined for some type constructors we've already seen:

**Example** (`F = ReadonlyArray`)

```typescript
const of = <A>(a: A): ReadonlyArray<A> => [a]
```

**Example** (`F = Option`)

```typescript
import * as O from 'fp-ts/Option'

const of = <A>(a: A): O.Option<A> => O.some(a)
```

**Example** (`F = IO`)

```typescript
import { IO } from 'fp-ts/IO'

const of = <A>(a: A): IO<A> => () => a
```

**Example** (`F = Task`)

```typescript
import { Task } from 'fp-ts/Task'

const of = <A>(a: A): Task<A> => () => Promise.resolve(a)
```

**Example** (`F = Reader`)

```typescript
import { Reader } from 'fp-ts/Reader'

const of = <R, A>(a: A): Reader<R, A> => () => a
```

**Demo**

[`05_applicative.ts`](src/05_applicative.ts)

## Applicative functors compose

Applicative functors compose, meaning that given two applicative functors `F` and `G`, their composition `F<G<A>>` is still an applicative functor.

**Example** (`F = Task`, `G = Option`)

The `of` of the composition is the composition of the `of`s:

```typescript
import { flow } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as O from 'fp-ts/Option'
import * as T from 'fp-ts/Task'

type TaskOption<A> = T.Task<O.Option<A>>

const of: <A>(a: A) => TaskOption<A> = flow(O.of, T.of)
```

the `ap` of the composition is obtained by the following pattern:

```typescript
const ap = <A>(
  fa: TaskOption<A>
): (<B>(fab: TaskOption<(a: A) => B>) => TaskOption<B>) =>
  flow(
    T.map((gab) => (ga: O.Option<A>) => O.ap(ga)(gab)),
    T.ap(fa)
  )
```

## Do applicative functors solve the general problem?

Not yet. There's one last very important case to consider: when **both** programs are effectful.

Yet again we need something more, in the following chapter we'll talk about one of the most important abstractions in functional programming: **monads**.

In the last chapter we have seen how we can compose an effectful program `f: (a: A) => F<B>` with an `n`-ary pure program `g`, if and only if the type constructor `F` admits an applicative functor instance:

| Program f | Program g     | Composition     |
| --------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| pure      | pure          | `g ∘ f`         |
| effectful | pure (unary)  | `map(g) ∘ f`    |
| effectful | pure, `n`-ary | `liftAn(g) ∘ f` |

But we need to solve one last, quite common, case: when **both** programs are effectful:

```typescript
f: (a: A) => F<B>
g: (b: B) => F<C>
```

What is the composition of `f` and `g`?

## The problem with nested contexts

Let's see few examples on why we need something more.

**Example** (`F = Array`)

Suppose we want to get followers' followers.

```typescript
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as A from 'fp-ts/ReadonlyArray'

interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
  readonly followers: ReadonlyArray<User>
}

const getFollowers = (user: User): ReadonlyArray<User> => user.followers

declare const user: User

// followersOfFollowers: ReadonlyArray<ReadonlyArray<User>>
const followersOfFollowers = pipe(user, getFollowers, A.map(getFollowers))
```

There's something wrong here, `followersOfFollowers` has a type `ReadonlyArray<ReadonlyArray<User>>` but we want `ReadonlyArray<User>`.

We need to **flatten** nested arrays.

The function `flatten: <A>(mma: ReadonlyArray<ReadonlyArray<A>>) => ReadonlyArray<A>` exported by the `fp-ts/ReadonlyArray` is exactly what we need:

```typescript
// followersOfFollowers: ReadonlyArray<User>
const followersOfFollowers = pipe(
  user,
  getFollowers,
  A.map(getFollowers),
  A.flatten
)
```

Cool! Let's see some other data type.

**Example** (`F = Option`)
Suppose you want to calculate the reciprocal of the first element of a numerical array:

```typescript
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as O from 'fp-ts/Option'
import * as A from 'fp-ts/ReadonlyArray'

const inverse = (n: number): O.Option<number> =>
  n === 0 ? O.none : O.some(1 / n)

// inverseHead: O.Option<O.Option<number>>
const inverseHead = pipe([1, 2, 3], A.head, O.map(inverse))
```

Oops, it happened again, `inverseHead` has type `Option<Option<number>>` but we want `Option<number>`.

We need to flatten again the nested `Option`s.

The `flatten: <A>(mma: Option<Option<A>>) => Option<A>` function exported by the `fp-ts/Option` module is what we need:

```typescript
// inverseHead: O.Option<number>
const inverseHead = pipe([1, 2, 3], A.head, O.map(inverse), O.flatten)
```

All of those `flatten` funcitons...They aren't a coincidence, there is a functional pattern behind the scenes: both the type constructors
`ReadonlyArray` and `Option` (and many others) admit a **monad instance** and

> `flatten` is the most peculiar operation of monads

**참고**. A common synonym of `flatten` is **join**.

So, what is a monad?

Here is how they are often presented...

## Monad Definition

**Definition**. A monad is defined by three things:

(1) a type constructor `M` admitting a functor instance

(2) a function `of` (also called **pure** or **return**) with the following signature:

```typescript
of: <A>(a: A) => M<A>
```

(3) a `chain` function (also called **flatMap** or **bind**) with the following signature:

```typescript
chain: <A, B>(f: (a: A) => M<B>) => (ma: M<A>) => M<B>
```

The `of` and `chain` functions need to obey three laws:

- `chain(of) ∘ f = f` (**Left identity**)
- `chain(f) ∘ of = f` (**Right identity**)
- `chain(h) ∘ (chain(g) ∘ f) = chain((chain(h) ∘ g)) ∘ f` (**Associativity**)

where `f`, `g`, `h` are all effectful functions and `∘` is the usual function composition.

When I saw this definition for the first time I had many questions:

- why exactly those two operation `of` and `chain`? and why to they have those signatures?
- why do they have those synonyms like "pure" or "flatMap"?
- why does laws need to hold true? What do they mean?
- if `flatten` is so important for monads, why it doesn't compare in its definition?

This chapter will try to answer all of these questions.

Let's get back to the core problem: what is the composition of two effectful functions `f` and `g`?

<img src="images/kleisli_arrows.png" alt="two Kleisli arrows, what's their composition?" width="450px" />

<center>(two Kleisli Arrows)</center>

**참고**. An effectful function is also called **Kleisli arrow**.

For the time being I don't even know the **type** of such composition.

But we've already seen some abstractions that talks specifically about composition. Do you remember what we said about categories?

> Categories capture the essence of composition

We can transform our problem into a category problem, meaning: can we find a category that models the composition of Kleisli arrows?

## The Kleisli category

<center>
<img src="images/kleisli.jpg" width="300" alt="Heinrich Kleisli" />

(Heinrich Kleisli, Swiss mathematician)

</center>

Let's try building a category _K_ (called **Kleisli category**) which contains _only_ Kleisli arrows:

- **objects** will be the same objects of the _TS_ category, so all TypeScript types.
- **morphisms** are built like this: every time there is a Kleisli arrow `f: A ⟼ M<B>` in _TS_ we draw an arrow `f': A ⟼ B` in _K_

<center>
<img src="images/kleisli_category.png" alt="above the TS category, below the K construction" width="400px" />

(above the composition in the _TS_ category, below the composition in the _K_ construction)

</center>

So what would be the composition of `f` and `g` in _K_?
It's th red arrow called `h'` in the image below:

<center>
<img src="images/kleisli_composition.png" alt="above the composition in the TS category, below the composition in the K construction" width="400px" />

(above the composition in the _TS_ category, below the composition in the _K_ construction)

</center>

Given that `h'` is an arrow from `A` to `C` in `K`, we can find a corresponding function `h` from `A` to `M<C>` in `TS`.

Thus, a good candidate for the following composition of `f` and `g` in _TS_ is still a Kleisli arrow with the following signature: `(a: A) => M<C>`.

Let's try implementing such a function.

## Defining `chain` step by step

The first point (1) of the monad definition tells us that `M` admits a functor instance, thus we can use the `map` function to transform the function `g: (b: B) => M<C>` into a function `map(g): (mb: M<B>) => M<M<C>>`

<center>
<img src="images/flatMap.png" alt="where chain comes from" width="450px" />

(how to obtain the `h` function)

</center>

We're stuck now though: there is no legal operation for the functor instance that allows us to flatten a value of type `M<M<C>>` into a value of type `M<C>`, we need an additional operation, let's call it `flatten`.

If we can define such operation then we can find the composition we were looking for:

```
h = flatten ∘ map(g) ∘ f
```

By joining the `flatten ∘ map(g)` names we get "flatMap", hence the name!

Thus we can get `chain` in this way

```
chain = flatten ∘ map(g)
```

<center>
<img src="images/chain.png" alt="come agisce `chain` sulla funzione `g`" width="400px" />

(how `chain` operates on the function `g`)

</center>

Now we can update our composition table

| Program f | Program g     | Composition     |
| --------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| pure      | pure          | `g ∘ f`         |
| effectful | pure (unary)  | `map(g) ∘ f`    |
| effectful | pure, `n`-ary | `liftAn(g) ∘ f` |
| effectful | effectful     | `chain(g) ∘ f`  |

What about `of`? Well, `of` comes from the identity morphisms in _K_: for every identity morphism 1<sub>A</sub> in _K_ there has to be a corresponding function from `A` to `M<A>` (that is, `of: <A>(a: A) => M<A>`).

<center>
<img src="images/of.png" alt="where of comes from" width="300px" />

(come ottenere `of`)

</center>

The fact that `of` is the neutral element for `chain` allows this kind of flux control (pretty common):

```typescript
pipe(
  mb,
  M.chain((b) => (predicate(b) ? M.of(b) : g(b)))
)
```

where `predicate: (b: B) => boolean`, `mb: M<B>` and `g: (b: B) => M<B>`.

Last question: where do the laws come from? They are nothing else but the categorical laws in _K_ translated to _TS_:

| Law            | _K_                               | _TS_                                                    |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Left identity  | 1<sub>B</sub> ∘ `f'` = `f'`       | `chain(of) ∘ f = f`                                     |
| Right identity | `f'` ∘ 1<sub>A</sub> = `f'`       | `chain(f) ∘ of = f`                                     |
| Associativity  | `h' ∘ (g' ∘ f') = (h' ∘ g') ∘ f'` | `chain(h) ∘ (chain(g) ∘ f) = chain((chain(h) ∘ g)) ∘ f` |

If we now go back to the examples that showed the problem with nested contexts we can solve them using `chain`:

```typescript
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as O from 'fp-ts/Option'
import * as A from 'fp-ts/ReadonlyArray'

interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
  readonly followers: ReadonlyArray<User>
}

const getFollowers = (user: User): ReadonlyArray<User> => user.followers

declare const user: User

const followersOfFollowers: ReadonlyArray<User> = pipe(
  user,
  getFollowers,
  A.chain(getFollowers)
)

const inverse = (n: number): O.Option<number> =>
  n === 0 ? O.none : O.some(1 / n)

const inverseHead: O.Option<number> = pipe([1, 2, 3], A.head, O.chain(inverse))
```

Let's see how is `chain` implemented for the usual type constructors we've already seen:

**Example** (`F = ReadonlyArray`)

```typescript
// transforms functions `B -> ReadonlyArray<C>` into functions `ReadonlyArray<B> -> ReadonlyArray<C>`
const chain = <B, C>(g: (b: B) => ReadonlyArray<C>) => (
  mb: ReadonlyArray<B>
): ReadonlyArray<C> => {
  const out: Array<C> = []
  for (const b of mb) {
    out.push(...g(b))
  }
  return out
}
```

**Example** (`F = Option`)

```typescript
import { match, none, Option } from 'fp-ts/Option'

// transforms functions `B -> Option<C>` into functions `Option<B> -> Option<C>`
const chain = <B, C>(g: (b: B) => Option<C>): ((mb: Option<B>) => Option<C>) =>
  match(() => none, g)
```

**Example** (`F = IO`)

```typescript
import { IO } from 'fp-ts/IO'

// transforms functions `B -> IO<C>` into functions `IO<B> -> IO<C>`
const chain = <B, C>(g: (b: B) => IO<C>) => (mb: IO<B>): IO<C> => () =>
  g(mb())()
```

**Example** (`F = Task`)

```typescript
import { Task } from 'fp-ts/Task'

// transforms functions `B -> Task<C>` into functions `Task<B> -> Task<C>`
const chain = <B, C>(g: (b: B) => Task<C>) => (mb: Task<B>): Task<C> => () =>
  mb().then((b) => g(b)())
```

**Example** (`F = Reader`)

```typescript
import { Reader } from 'fp-ts/Reader'

// transforms functions `B -> Reader<R, C>` into functions `Reader<R, B> -> Reader<R, C>`
const chain = <B, R, C>(g: (b: B) => Reader<R, C>) => (
  mb: Reader<R, B>
): Reader<R, C> => (r) => g(mb(r))(r)
```

## Manipulating programs

Let's see now, how thanks to referential transparency and the monad concept we can programmaticaly manipulate programs.

Here's a small program that reads / writes a file:

```typescript
import { log } from 'fp-ts/Console'
import { IO, chain } from 'fp-ts/IO'
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as fs from 'fs'

// -----------------------------------------
// library functions
// -----------------------------------------

const readFile = (filename: string): IO<string> => () =>
  fs.readFileSync(filename, 'utf-8')

const writeFile = (filename: string, data: string): IO<void> => () =>
  fs.writeFileSync(filename, data, { encoding: 'utf-8' })

// API derived from the previous functions
const modifyFile = (filename: string, f: (s: string) => string): IO<void> =>
  pipe(
    readFile(filename),
    chain((s) => writeFile(filename, f(s)))
  )

// -----------------------------------------
// program
// -----------------------------------------

const program1 = pipe(
  readFile('file.txt'),
  chain(log),
  chain(() => modifyFile('file.txt', (s) => s + '\n// eof')),
  chain(() => readFile('file.txt')),
  chain(log)
)
```

The actions:

```typescript
pipe(readFile('file.txt'), chain(log))
```

is repeated more than once in the program, but given that referential transparency holds we can factor it and assign it to a constant:

```typescript
const read = pipe(readFile('file.txt'), chain(log))
const modify = modifyFile('file.txt', (s) => s + '\n// eof')

const program2 = pipe(
  read,
  chain(() => modify),
  chain(() => read)
)
```

We can even define a combinator and leverage it to make the code more compact:

```typescript
const interleave = <A, B>(action: IO<A>, middle: IO<B>): IO<A> =>
  pipe(
    action,
    chain(() => middle),
    chain(() => action)
  )

const program3 = interleave(read, modify)
```

Another example: implementing a function similar to Unix' `time` (the part related to the execution time) for `IO`.

```typescript
import * as IO from 'fp-ts/IO'
import { now } from 'fp-ts/Date'
import { log } from 'fp-ts/Console'
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'

// logs the computation lenght in milliseconds
export const time = <A>(ma: IO.IO<A>): IO.IO<A> =>
  pipe(
    now,
    IO.chain((startMillis) =>
      pipe(
        ma,
        IO.chain((a) =>
          pipe(
            now,
            IO.chain((endMillis) =>
              pipe(
                log(`Elapsed: ${endMillis - startMillis}`),
                IO.map(() => a)
              )
            )
          )
        )
      )
    )
  )
```

**Digression**. As you can notice, using `chain` when it is required to maintain a scope leads to verbose code.
In languages that support monadic style natively there is often syntax support that goes by the name of "do notation" which eases this kind of situations.

Let's see a Haskell example

```haskell
now :: IO Int
now = undefined -- `undefined` in Haskell is equivalent to TypeScript's declare

log :: String -> IO ()
log = undefined

time :: IO a -> IO a
time ma = do
  startMillis <- now
  a <- ma
  endMillis <- now
  log ("Elapsed:" ++ show (endMillis - startMillis))
  return a
```

TypeScript does not support such syntax, but it can be emulated with something similar:

```typescript
import { log } from 'fp-ts/Console'
import { now } from 'fp-ts/Date'
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as IO from 'fp-ts/IO'

// logs the computation lenght in milliseconds
export const time = <A>(ma: IO.IO<A>): IO.IO<A> =>
  pipe(
    IO.Do,
    IO.bind('startMillis', () => now),
    IO.bind('a', () => ma),
    IO.bind('endMillis', () => now),
    IO.chainFirst(({ endMillis, startMillis }) =>
      log(`Elapsed: ${endMillis - startMillis}`)
    ),
    IO.map(({ a }) => a)
  )
```

Let's see a usage example of the `time` combinator:

```typescript
import { randomInt } from 'fp-ts/Random'
import { Monoid, concatAll } from 'fp-ts/Monoid'
import { replicate } from 'fp-ts/ReadonlyArray'

const fib = (n: number): number => (n <= 1 ? 1 : fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2))

// launches `fib` with a random integer between 30 and 35
// logging both the input and output
const randomFib: IO.IO<void> = pipe(
  randomInt(30, 35),
  IO.chain((n) => log([n, fib(n)]))
)

// a monoid instance for `IO<void>`
const MonoidIO: Monoid<IO.IO<void>> = {
  concat: (first, second) => () => {
    first()
    second()
  },
  empty: IO.of(undefined)
}

// executes `n` times the `mv` computation
const replicateIO = (n: number, mv: IO.IO<void>): IO.IO<void> =>
  concatAll(MonoidIO)(replicate(n, mv))

// -------------------
// usage example
// -------------------

time(replicateIO(3, randomFib))()
/*
[ 31, 2178309 ]
[ 33, 5702887 ]
[ 30, 1346269 ]
Elapsed: 89
*/
```

Logs also the partial:

```typescript
time(replicateIO(3, time(randomFib)))()
/*
[ 33, 5702887 ]
Elapsed: 54
[ 30, 1346269 ]
Elapsed: 13
[ 32, 3524578 ]
Elapsed: 39
Elapsed: 106
*/
```

One of the most interesting aspects of working with the monadic interface (`map`, `of`, `chain`) is the possibility to inject dependencies which the program needs, including the **way of concatenating different computations**.

To see that, let's refactor the small program that reads and writes a file:

```typescript
import { IO } from 'fp-ts/IO'
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'

// -----------------------------------------
// Deps interface, what we would call a "port" in the Hexagonal Architecture
// -----------------------------------------

interface Deps {
  readonly readFile: (filename: string) => IO<string>
  readonly writeFile: (filename: string, data: string) => IO<void>
  readonly log: <A>(a: A) => IO<void>
  readonly chain: <A, B>(f: (a: A) => IO<B>) => (ma: IO<A>) => IO<B>
}

// -----------------------------------------
// program
// -----------------------------------------

const program4 = (D: Deps) => {
  const modifyFile = (filename: string, f: (s: string) => string) =>
    pipe(
      D.readFile(filename),
      D.chain((s) => D.writeFile(filename, f(s)))
    )

  return pipe(
    D.readFile('file.txt'),
    D.chain(D.log),
    D.chain(() => modifyFile('file.txt', (s) => s + '\n// eof')),
    D.chain(() => D.readFile('file.txt')),
    D.chain(D.log)
  )
}

// -----------------------------------------
// a `Deps` instance, what we would call an "adapter" in the Hexagonal Architecture
// -----------------------------------------

import * as fs from 'fs'
import { log } from 'fp-ts/Console'
import { chain } from 'fp-ts/IO'

const DepsSync: Deps = {
  readFile: (filename) => () => fs.readFileSync(filename, 'utf-8'),
  writeFile: (filename: string, data: string) => () =>
    fs.writeFileSync(filename, data, { encoding: 'utf-8' }),
  log,
  chain
}

// dependency injection
program4(DepsSync)()
```

There's more, we can even abstract the effect in which the program runs. We can define our own `FileSystem` effect (the effect representing read-write operations over the file system):

```typescript
import { IO } from 'fp-ts/IO'
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'

// -----------------------------------------
// our program's effect
// -----------------------------------------

interface FileSystem<A> extends IO<A> {}

// -----------------------------------------
// dependencies
// -----------------------------------------

interface Deps {
  readonly readFile: (filename: string) => FileSystem<string>
  readonly writeFile: (filename: string, data: string) => FileSystem<void>
  readonly log: <A>(a: A) => FileSystem<void>
  readonly chain: <A, B>(
    f: (a: A) => FileSystem<B>
  ) => (ma: FileSystem<A>) => FileSystem<B>
}

// -----------------------------------------
// program
// -----------------------------------------

const program4 = (D: Deps) => {
  const modifyFile = (filename: string, f: (s: string) => string) =>
    pipe(
      D.readFile(filename),
      D.chain((s) => D.writeFile(filename, f(s)))
    )

  return pipe(
    D.readFile('file.txt'),
    D.chain(D.log),
    D.chain(() => modifyFile('file.txt', (s) => s + '\n// eof')),
    D.chain(() => D.readFile('file.txt')),
    D.chain(D.log)
  )
}
```

With a simple change in the definition of the `FileSystem` effect. we can modify the program to make it run asynchronously

```diff
// -----------------------------------------
// our program's effect
// -----------------------------------------

-interface FileSystem<A> extends IO<A> {}
+interface FileSystem<A> extends Task<A> {}
```

now all there's left is to modify the `Deps` instance to adapt to the new definition.

```typescript
import { Task } from 'fp-ts/Task'
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'

// -----------------------------------------
// our program's effect (modified)
// -----------------------------------------

interface FileSystem<A> extends Task<A> {}

// -----------------------------------------
// dependencies (NOT modified)
// -----------------------------------------

interface Deps {
  readonly readFile: (filename: string) => FileSystem<string>
  readonly writeFile: (filename: string, data: string) => FileSystem<void>
  readonly log: <A>(a: A) => FileSystem<void>
  readonly chain: <A, B>(
    f: (a: A) => FileSystem<B>
  ) => (ma: FileSystem<A>) => FileSystem<B>
}

// -----------------------------------------
// program (NOT modified)
// -----------------------------------------

const program5 = (D: Deps) => {
  const modifyFile = (filename: string, f: (s: string) => string) =>
    pipe(
      D.readFile(filename),
      D.chain((s) => D.writeFile(filename, f(s)))
    )

  return pipe(
    D.readFile('file.txt'),
    D.chain(D.log),
    D.chain(() => modifyFile('file.txt', (s) => s + '\n// eof')),
    D.chain(() => D.readFile('file.txt')),
    D.chain(D.log)
  )
}

// -----------------------------------------
// a `Deps` instance (modified)
// -----------------------------------------

import * as fs from 'fs'
import { log } from 'fp-ts/Console'
import { chain, fromIO } from 'fp-ts/Task'

const DepsAsync: Deps = {
  readFile: (filename) => () =>
    new Promise((resolve) =>
      fs.readFile(filename, { encoding: 'utf-8' }, (_, s) => resolve(s))
    ),
  writeFile: (filename: string, data: string) => () =>
    new Promise((resolve) => fs.writeFile(filename, data, () => resolve())),
  log: (a) => fromIO(log(a)),
  chain
}

// dependency injection
program5(DepsAsync)()
```

**Quiz**. The previous examples overlook, on purpose, possible errors. Example give: the file we're operating on may not exist at all. How could we modify the `FileSystem` effect to take this into account?

```typescript
import { Task } from 'fp-ts/Task'
import { pipe } from 'fp-ts/function'
import * as E from 'fp-ts/Either'

// -----------------------------------------
// our program's effect (modified)
// -----------------------------------------

interface FileSystem<A> extends Task<E.Either<Error, A>> {}

// -----------------------------------------
// dependencies (NOT modified)
// -----------------------------------------

interface Deps {
  readonly readFile: (filename: string) => FileSystem<string>
  readonly writeFile: (filename: string, data: string) => FileSystem<void>
  readonly log: <A>(a: A) => FileSystem<void>
  readonly chain: <A, B>(
    f: (a: A) => FileSystem<B>
  ) => (ma: FileSystem<A>) => FileSystem<B>
}

// -----------------------------------------
// program (NOT modified)
// -----------------------------------------

const program5 = (D: Deps) => {
  const modifyFile = (filename: string, f: (s: string) => string) =>
    pipe(
      D.readFile(filename),
      D.chain((s) => D.writeFile(filename, f(s)))
    )

  return pipe(
    D.readFile('-.txt'),
