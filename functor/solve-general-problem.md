## Do functors solve the general problem?

Not yet. Functors allow us to compose an effectful program `f` with a pure program `g`, but `g` has to be a **unary** function, accepting one single argument. What happens if `g` takes two or more arguments?

| Program f | Program g               | Composition  |
| --------- | ----------------------- | ------------ |
| pure      | pure                    | `g ∘ f`      |
| effectful | pure (unary)            | `map(g) ∘ f` |
| effectful | pure (`n`-ary, `n > 1`) | ?            |

To manage this circumstance we need something _more_, in the next chapter we'll see another important abstraction in functional programming: **applicative functors**.
