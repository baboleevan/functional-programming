## Currying

First of all we need to model a function that accepts two arguments of type `B` and `C` (we can use a tuple for this) and returns a value of type `D`:

```typescript
g: (b: B, c: C) => D
```

We can rewrite `g` using a technique called **currying**.

> Currying is the technique of translating the evaluation of a function that takes multiple arguments into evaluating a sequence of functions, **each with a single argument**. For example, a function that takes two arguments, one from `B` and one from `C`, and produces outputs in `D`, by currying is translated into a function that takes a single argument from `C` and produces as outputs functions from `B` to `C`.

(source: [currying on wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying))

Thus, through currying, we can rewrite `g` as:

```typescript
g: (b: B) => (c: C) => D
```

**Example**

```typescript
interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
  readonly followers: ReadonlyArray<User>
}

const addFollower = (follower: User, user: User): User => ({
  ...user,
  followers: [...user.followers, follower]
})
```

Let's refactor `addFollower` through currying

```typescript
interface User {
  readonly id: number
  readonly name: string
  readonly followers: ReadonlyArray<User>
}

const addFollower = (follower: User) => (user: User): User => ({
  ...user,
  followers: [...user.followers, follower]
})

// -------------------
// usage example
// -------------------

const user: User = { id: 1, name: 'Ruth R. Gonzalez', followers: [] }
const follower: User = { id: 3, name: 'Marsha J. Joslyn', followers: [] }

console.log(addFollower(follower)(user))
/*
{
  id: 1,
  name: 'Ruth R. Gonzalez',
  followers: [ { id: 3, name: 'Marsha J. Joslyn', followers: [] } ]
}
*/
```
